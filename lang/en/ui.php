During this phase, every unit that charged or was already in close combat can attack, using their melee weapons, fists, claws, and similar. Attacks are resolved by rolling to hit, to wound, and then saving throws, just like in the shooting phase, but with the specific melee weapon rules. You choose the order in which units attack, which can be crucial since some units have abilities that activate before or after attacking. Close combat is often decisive, as it can wipe out enemy troops and open the way to control the battlefield.',

Some units have powers or effects that trigger right here, such as commanders boosting nearby troops. If your army uses orders (like Astra Militarum), this is the moment to assign them.

It’s a crucial phase for controlling space and putting pressure on your opponent. During this phase, you can move each unit in your army up to its Movement characteristic (shown on its profile). You can move in any direction but cannot pass through enemy models or impassable terrain. If you want to push further, you can choose to Advance: roll a die and add that number to your movement distance. However, if you Advance, that unit cannot shoot or charge for the rest of the turn, so choose carefully. In this phase, you can also make a unit retreat from close combat (if it’s engaged), but in that case, the unit won’t be able to do anything else for the rest of the turn. Moving your units at the right time and place is key to controlling the game. Use this phase to seize objectives, take cover in terrain, and prepare for shooting or assault.',

To make an attack, you declare the weapon and target, then roll to hit (based on your unit’s skill), then roll to wound by comparing the weapon’s Strength to the target’s Toughness. Finally, the enemy rolls saving throws: if they fail, they suffer wounds or lose models. Some weapons have special rules, such as explosions or shots that ignore defenses, and you can use Stratagems to improve outcomes. A well-played phase can turn the tide of battle.',

In this phase, you choose which units will charge and measure the distance between them and the enemies. To charge, you roll a six-sided die and add the distance your unit can normally move. If the result is equal to or greater than the distance between the unit and the enemy, the charge succeeds and the unit can move into contact with the target, starting close combat. Units that charge cannot shoot during the shooting phase of the turn, so this is a tactical choice: sacrificing ranged power for melee strength. Charging is key to breaking enemy lines, protecting your weaker troops, or quickly eliminating key enemy units.',
